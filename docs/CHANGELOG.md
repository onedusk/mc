# Changelog

All notable changes to Mr. Cleann (mc) will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   **Nested Item Pruning**: Implemented intelligent pruning algorithm that removes redundant nested items from the scan results
    -   New `prune_nested_items()` function in `engine/mod.rs` that filters out child items when their parent is already marked for deletion
    -   Dramatically reduces item count in scan results (e.g., 1,711 → 45 items in large monorepos)
    -   Prevents race conditions in parallel deletion where multiple threads attempt to delete already-removed nested items
    -   Provides cleaner, more intuitive output showing only top-level directories like `node_modules/` instead of thousands of nested paths
    -   Improves performance by eliminating redundant deletion attempts
    -   Comprehensive test coverage for pruning logic including edge cases

### Changed

-   **Cleaner Output**: Scan results now show only meaningful top-level items instead of every nested file and directory
    -   Example: Shows `node_modules/` (5 GB) instead of listing every package's dist, build, and cache directories separately
    -   Output format now matches user expectations and is consistent with traditional shell script behavior using `find -prune`
    -   Makes it easier to understand what will be deleted at a glance

### Performance

-   **38x reduction** in item processing for typical projects (1,711 → 45 items)
-   **Eliminated redundant work**: Parent directory removal via `fs::remove_dir_all()` now happens only once
-   **No ENOENT errors**: Prevented parallel threads from attempting to delete already-deleted nested items
-   **Consistent throughput**: ~163 MB/s deletion speed maintained (I/O bound, as expected)
-   **Benchmark results** (duskdev monorepo):
    -   Items processed: 45 (down from 1,711)
    -   Space freed: 3.83 GB
    -   Execution time: 23.5 seconds
    -   CPU utilization: 74%

### Fixed

-   **Compilation Errors**: Resolved 6 compilation errors preventing the project from building:
    -   Fixed walkdir::Error API usage in scanner.rs - replaced non-existent `is_loop()` method with `loop_ancestor()` for symlink cycle detection
    -   Added missing `scan_errors` field to CleanReport struct initializations in cleaner.rs (2 locations)
    -   Fixed scanner.scan() return value destructuring in main.rs to properly handle tuple of (items, scan_errors)
    -   Removed reference to non-existent `cli.nuclear` field in safety checks
    -   Properly propagated scan_errors through the cleaning pipeline to final report output
-   **Unused Import Warning**: Removed unused `PatternConfig` import from scanner.rs tests

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

-   **Comprehensive Rustdoc**: Implemented a full suite of `rustdoc` comments across the entire codebase in three passes: initial high-level, detailed technical, and a final polish for clarity and completeness. All public APIs are now thoroughly documented with examples.
-   **Full Test Suite**: Added a comprehensive set of unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the application. The test suite covers configuration logic, pattern matching, the scanning engine, and end-to-end cleaning operations.

### Changed

-   **Improved Error Handling**: The file scanner now captures and reports I/O errors and symbolic link cycles instead of silently ignoring them. These errors are now displayed in the final report, providing better diagnostics to the user.

### Removed

-   **Nuclear Mode**: Removed the `--nuclear` flag and its associated logic to enhance the safety of the tool and prevent the accidental deletion of sensitive files like `.git` directories.
