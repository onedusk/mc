# Changelog

All notable changes to Mr. Cleann (mc) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   **Technical Spec**: Added `docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` outlining the performance-critical pipeline, tuning knobs, and validation checklist.
-   **Benchmarks**: Introduced `benches/performance.rs` (Criterion) to track scanner and pruning regressions via `cargo bench --bench performance`.

### Changed

-   **Streaming Scanner**: Reworked `Scanner::scan` to stream `WalkDir` entries with `par_bridge`, accumulate file sizes in a single traversal, and aggregate directory totals without per-directory re-walks.
-   **Pattern Matching**: `PatternMatcher::matches_with_type` now accepts an optional `FileType`, removing redundant metadata syscalls during scans while keeping the public API intact.
-   **Parallel Cleaner**: `ParallelCleaner` reuses a dedicated Rayon thread pool, processes items with `par_iter().with_min_len(...)`, and collects errors through a shared mutex-backed buffer instead of crossbeam channels.
-   **Nested Item Pruning**: `prune_nested_items` keeps the original behaviour but now prunes ancestors in linear time using a rolling `HashSet` of kept paths.
-   **Test Suite**: Permission and symlink-cycle tests updated to reflect the new streaming scanner and UNIX-specific behaviours.

### Performance

-   **Lower Latency Scans**: Single-pass metadata collection eliminates recursive directory walks and significantly reduces filesystem IO.
-   **Reduced Overhead**: Reused Rayon pool removes per-run thread pool rebuild costs and improves scaling on SSD-heavy workloads.
-   **Benchmark Guidance**: Criterion suite documents expected usage and storage of baseline runs in the technical spec.

### Fixed

-   **Category Breakdown**: Category breakdown now shows accurate counts after pruning nested items. Previously displayed pre-pruning counts (all matched items) instead of post-pruning counts (items to be deleted), causing significant discrepancies in the summary output.
-   **Pattern Coverage**: Restored the `*.log` builtin pattern to ensure logs continue to be detected by default.
-   **Symlink Cycle Detection**: Regression tests now explicitly enable link following and record cycle errors emitted by WalkDir.
-   **Permission Handling**: Test fixtures set restrictive UNIX permissions (0o000) guaranteeing permission-denied paths are surfaced in scan errors.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

-   **Comprehensive Rustdoc**: Implemented a full suite of `rustdoc` comments across the entire codebase in three passes: initial high-level, detailed technical, and a final polish for clarity and completeness. All public APIs are now thoroughly documented with examples.
-   **Full Test Suite**: Added a comprehensive set of unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the application. The test suite covers configuration logic, pattern matching, the scanning engine, and end-to-end cleaning operations.

### Changed

-   **Improved Error Handling**: The file scanner now captures and reports I/O errors and symbolic link cycles instead of silently ignoring them. These errors are now displayed in the final report, providing better diagnostics to the user.

### Removed

-   **Nuclear Mode**: Removed the `--nuclear` flag and its associated logic to enhance the safety of the tool and prevent the accidental deletion of sensitive files like `.git` directories.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-26
