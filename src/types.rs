//! This module defines the core data types and error types used throughout the `mc` crate.
//!
//! It provides a centralized location for structures that represent the state and results
//! of the cleaning process, ensuring consistency across different modules. These types
//! are designed to be serializable with `serde` for potential use in structured
//! output formats like JSON.
