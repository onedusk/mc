> run `cargp build --release` then receive response, when you receive response, you will then understand what this is for =>
  this is a protocol to follow when fixing the build errors/warnings/issues
  - **WEAVE** = "Workflows defined, Events subscribed, Actions atomic, Version locked, Error compensated"

⏺ I'll run the cargo build command to understand what we're working with.

⏺ Bash(cargo build --release)
  ⎿  warning: unused import: `Deserialize`
      --> src/types.rs:3:13
       |
     … +39 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now I understand - this is a Rust project with build warnings that need to be fixed following the WEAVE protocol. Let me
  create a todo list to track the fixes needed, then systematically address each warning.

⏺ Following the WEAVE protocol, I'll fix each warning atomically. Let me start by examining and fixing each file:

         Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 12.72s

⏺ ✅ WEAVE protocol successfully applied - all build warnings fixed:

  - Workflows defined - Systematic approach to fixing each warning
  - Events subscribed - Responded to each compiler warning
  - Actions atomic - Each fix was a single, focused change
  - Version locked - All changes preserved functionality
  - Error compensated - Build now compiles cleanly without warnings

  The Rust project now builds successfully in release mode with no warnings.
